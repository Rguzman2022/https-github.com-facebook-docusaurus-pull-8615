Introduction

A project called Docusaurus makes it simple to create, distribute, and manage open source project sites. Use docusaurus.new to try Docusaurus in a playground right away.

Easy to Begin

Docusaurus is designed to launch into operation as quickly as feasible. To free you up to work on your project, we designed Docusaurus to manage website development.

Localizable

Through CrowdIn, Docusaurus has translation support. By interpreting your documents, you may strengthen and expand your global network.

Adjustable

Although Docusaurus comes pre-loaded with the essential pages and features you'll need to get going, such as a home page, a documents part, a weblog, and other help sites, it is also fully configurable so you can create a site that are all yours.

Implementation

The installation CLI should be used to build your site: npm init docusaurus@latest

For additional info, read the documents.



Making a contribution

We made Docusaurus available because it enables us to expand more effectively and supports the numerous OSS initiatives inside Facebook. We anticipate that the initiative will be useful to other organisations. Any donations from the communities are appreciated.

A code of behaviour

Members in the initiative are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct that Facebook has issued. Please read the entire document so that you are aware of the acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.
